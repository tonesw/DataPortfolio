# DataPortfolio

These are two projects I have worked on in spare time during the pandemic after I graduated! One is for a library database system and contains TSQL code to automate Library
Database tasks. The other is Data queries meant to clean and visualize data from a raw dataset on various covid-19 related metrics.
